# Unlike the previous examples, this manifest lists more than one resource: the
# plugin as usual, and the UI.  The descriptions are similar, but have
# different types, so the host can decide from this file alone whether or not
# it is interested, and avoid following the `rdfs:seeAlso` link if not (though
# in this case both are described in the same file).
